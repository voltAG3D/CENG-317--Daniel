	<li>Next week the placard (one per group) is due, post a link to your group's submission on your blog (<a href="https://github.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/tree/master/documentation/Week8AnalyticRubricforPlacard.xml">rubric</a>). A <a href="https://github.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/tree/master/documentation/DRAFTMulticolourPlaque.pub">template</a> is available.</li>
	<li>Next week the 30 Second Script is due, this is to help you explain what you have accomplished while demo'ing it for the camera.</li>
	<li>It turns outs that the newest version of Rasbian has realvnc-vnc-server installed by default which conflicts with xrdp. Instead of installing xrdp on your development platform you can install <a href="https://www.realvnc.com/download/viewer/">VNC Viewer</a> on your desktop to connect instead of using Remote Desktop Connection. The boot options still need to be set along with ensuring VNC (and I2C) is enabled via Menu > Preferences > Raspberry Pi Configuration > Interfaces and such an image is in the dropbox as before. Please let me know if you have had success purging realvnc-vnc-server and installing then using xrdp.

   <ul>
	<li>This week the placard (one per group) is due.</li>
	<li>This week the individual 30 second script is due.</li>
	<li>There was an <a href="http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html">OpenSCAD</a> demonstration, a laser cutting explanation using Eagle, as well as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Movie_Maker#2017">MovieMaker</a> demonstration.

	<li>Next week the 30 second build video is due. It should be a concatenation of:<ul>
	 <li>a 2 second opening title screen with the project and student name,</li>
     <li>a few seconds of the parts that arrived,</li>
     <li>a few seconds of the parts assembly,</li>
     <li>a few seconds of the power up; and,</li>
     <li>a few seconds about the functionality you plan to demonstrate at the open house.</li></ul>
	</li>
	<li>The open house demonstration will take place in J202. We will have to reconfigure the room (<a href="https://github.com/six0four/StudentSenseHat/tree/master/documentation/Week10J202OpenHouse.vsdx">floorplan</a>) and note that some of the power outlets do not work so not all of you will have power.

   <li>The section you attend, are registered in, and are a group member in, must match.</li>
   <li>Introduction to the course outline/blackboard/this site, two main objectives: your project (hardware with enterprise wireless, mobile application, database with web interface) and the matching <a href="https://www.oacett.org/downloads/get_certified/technology_report/Technology_Report_Guidelines.pdf">Technical Report</a>.</li> 
   <li>Regarding project choice, students typically proceed with the hardware and mobile application from the prerequisite courses. I am, however, looking for students interested in contributing to an applied research project with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c5pfFmr08Q">Crystal Fountains</a>.</li>
   <li>Markdown: <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Web-Development-tutorials/Up-Running-Markdown/438888-2.html">Tutorial</a>.</li>
   <li>References: <a href="http://library.humber.ca/help/apa">APA format</a></li>
   <li>Relevant technical references: visit <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/advsearch.jsp">IEEE's advanced search</a> click on “My Subscribed Content” from on campus, and type your search terms e.g. “iot market” into the search field.</li>
   <li>For next week: your group or you individually must choose the project's github site (belonging to student A), print your proposal to a pdf saved in the repository and hand me (within the first fifteen mininutes of next class) the two relevant pages printed out, the one with the inline citations and one with the references list (/5).</li>
   <li>Having each part of the project present every week (including hardware) is required and forms a portion of that week's deliverable's grade.</li>
