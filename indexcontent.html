			<h3> Week 11 hardware </h3>
			<p> I burnt out another motor after miswiring it and now i can no longer turn the arm but it will still work just cannot turn but will bend forwards and backwards as the other 
			motors work.</p>

			<h3> Week 10 hardware </h3>
		<p> burnt out 2 motors than had to buy 2 more and burnt out 1 more and also found out the pi has a floating 3.3 volts which will send
			signals from the pi to the arm randomly moving it without the button so in order to fix this i added a pull down resistor to each button
			to stop the floating 3.3 volts. There also isnt enough PWM pins and GPIO pins for the motors  for all 5 motors. so the arm will not be able to turn
			left or right.

		<h3> Week 9 hardware </h3> 
		<p> Progress report: after testing the motors 2 out of the 5 have been burned our and such i will have to buy 2 more which will be 20$ also will have to get more wires and buttons. Another thing is the 3d 
			printed arm is broken and i have sent a new email requesting new parts. I have code that moves the arm forward and backwards and a stop button. each motor will have 2 buttons that will move it.
			Some things have changed since the start of the project of the arm like i would have only used 2 buttons but as i have said before i will be using 2 buttons for each motor so the user can move it more freely.</p> 
		<li> https://learn.adafruit.com/trainable-robotic-arm/overview i borrowed the arm from here but instead of an arundio board i am using a pi </li>
