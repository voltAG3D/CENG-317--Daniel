<li>The single board microcomputer, comprised of a 900MHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU with 1GB SDRAM, 10/100 Mbit/s Ethernet, GPIO, UART, I2C bus, SPI bus, and 8 GB of Secure Digital storage from the Humber College Institute of Technology & Advanced Learning North Campus Technology Parts Crib can be tried out by following: <a href="http://munro.humber.ca/~mdrk0011/projects/cribpi.php">getting started http://munro.humber.ca/~mdrk0011/projects/cribpi.php</a>.</li>

<li>The following case for is used for the parts crib Broadcom development platforms (a Pi 3 also fits) http://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-black-case.html and we bought the USB network adaptors from Tiger Direct.   </li>
<li>More detailed instructions are available on Lynda.com plus Paul Moggach's technical notes. It turns outs that the newest version of Rasbian has realvnc-vnc-server installed by default which conflicts with xrdp.</li>
<li>Instead of installing xrdp on your development platform you can install VNC Viewer on your desktop to connect instead of using Remote Desktop Connection.</li>
<li>The boot options still need to be set along with ensuring VNC (and I2C) is enabled via Menu > Preferences > Raspberry Pi Configuration > Interfaces and such an image is in the DropBoxes as before.</li>
<li>Please let me know if you have had success purging realvnc-vnc-server and installing then using xrdp. Something along the lines of sudo apt-get purge realvnc-vnc-server, sudo apt-get install xrdp, plus relevant configuration.</li>
