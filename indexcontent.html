		<h3> Week 9 hardware </h3> 
		<p> Progress report: after testing the motors 2 out of the 5 have been burned our and such i will have to buy 2 more which will be 20$ also will have to get more wires and buttons. Another thing is the 3d 
			printed arm is broken and i have sent a new email requesting new parts. I have code that moves the arm forward and backwards and a stop button. each motor will have 2 buttons that will move it</p> 
		<li> https://learn.adafruit.com/trainable-robotic-arm/overview i borrowed the arm from here but instead of an arundio board i am using a pi </li>
